# .vimrc
My personal .vimrc!

My goal is to create a configuration where all critical parts of my vim usage
are completely standard and out of the box, and all `nice to have`s and visuals
are completely tweaked out. I care about minimalism only for the pragmatic
purpose of being able to port my local workflows to remote or foreign machines.

That is to say:
- If it partains to local development only, then crank it up to 11
- If it's critical flow, keep it og.
